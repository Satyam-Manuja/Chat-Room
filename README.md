This real-time chat room application uses Socket.IO to establish a persistent WebSocket connection between the client and server. When a user joins a chat room, the server maintains the connection and listens for events such as sending and receiving messages. Messages are instantly broadcast to all connected users in the same room without page refresh. The frontend built in React displays live updates, while the Node.js backend handles real-time communication and user sessions, ensuring fast and seamless interaction.
